# nikarh/fileserver-sftpd-backup

This image can be used to make daily backups of your data.
You can mount something to a `/volumes` folder. Each folder inside will be treated as a candidate for a backup, e.g. if you have `/volumes/A`, `/volumes/B` and `/volumes/C`, then `A`, `B` and `C` will be considered as separate entities.
Each candidate for a backup will be tar-xzipped, a timestamp will be appended to a filename, and a file will be copied to SFTP server. This tool will try to keep only the latest N number of backups per candidate.
