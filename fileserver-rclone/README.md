This is a `rclone/rclone` image with additional `inotify-tools` installed.

## ⚠️ Automated build

This docker image is rebuilt automatically weekly with latest alpine base image and latest dependencies. This can lead to broken images in case the packages installed are not backward compatible in their configs or behavior.
